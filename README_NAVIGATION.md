# SEE SLIDES

This file is only a part of multiple sets of presentation slides. If you are reading this, consider
viewing slides instead. However, this can't point you to the actual slides. (Several presentations
use this file.) See

- the GitHub project (or its clone/copy) you that referred you to this file; or
- `index.html` at the root of the actual presentation that referred to this file; or
- if you open this on GitHub pages (under `https://some-domain.github.io`), or through a local/other
  webserver - then see <../../index.html> for the whole presentation. or
- the original author's [list of
presentations](https://github.com/peter-kehl/peter-kehl/blob/main/README.md).

If you are reading this, or any related `README*.md` files (referred to from `index.html` of the
actual presentation):

- You will not be able to see source code examples as a part of the `README*md` documents. Instead,
  follow links to the respective source code. Those links highlight respective line ranges. However,
  source code loaded in the slides may be newer than the source code links in `README*md` files. And
  source code shown on a video recording (if there is one) may be older or newer (than source code
  links in `README*md` files).
- You will need to open other `README*.md` documents that follow. See the end of this
  file, and end of the successive `README*.md` documents.

# Slides Navigation

<!-- The following applies when viewing this through via ./index.html, either on GitHub pages or
     served by a local (or other) web server.
-->
<!-- Can't apply https://revealjs.com/markdown/#element-attributes like .element: class="..."
     to list items. That doesn't add the class to the whole list item, but it adds the class only to
     an auto-generated paragraph in that list item.
     Having a whole list inside a <span class="without_keyboard">...</span> doesn't work either
     (Reveal.js then doesn't generate an HTML list).
     Yet another try: We can't write <ol class="..."> and </ol> as raw HTML and have the list items
     entered in Markdown - they don't get transformed to HTML.
     Hence, we write raw HTML. For that we disable
     https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint > MD033.
